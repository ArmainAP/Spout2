Spout2 - VirtualDJ plugins

“VDJSpoutReceiver.dll” and “VDJSpoutSender.dll” are 32bit plugins developed using the 
VirtualDJ 8 plugin SDK.

VDJSpoutSender.dll must be copied to the VirtualDJ 8 - Plugins>VideoEffect folder
VDJSpoutReceiver.dll must be copied to the VirtualDJ 8 - Plugins>Visualisations folder

The plugins are only compatible with VirtualDJ 8 will not work on VirtualDJ 7 or earlier.

SpoutPanel.exe is an executable program used by VDJSpoutReceiver that shows the list
of running Spout senders and allows the user to select one. This will be detected
after Spout installation or, if there has been no installation, has to be copied
to the host application path, not the plugins folder.
