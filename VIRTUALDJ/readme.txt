Spout2 - VirtualDJ plugins

“VDJSpoutReceiver.dll” and “VDJSpoutSender.dll” are 32bit plugins developed using the VirtualDJ plugin SDK

VDJSpoutSender.dll must be copied to the VirtualDJ Plugins>VideoEffect folder
VDJSpoutReceiver.dll must be copied to the VirtualDJ Plugins>Visualisations folder

SpoutPanel.exe is an executable program used by SpoutReceiver2 that shows the list
of running Spout senders and allows the user to select one. This will be detected
after Spout installation or, if there has been no installation, has to be copied
to the host application path, not the plugins folder.
