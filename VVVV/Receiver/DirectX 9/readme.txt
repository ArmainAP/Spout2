==========================
DIRECTX 9 RECEIVER EXAMPLE
==========================


VVVV must be started with the /dx9ex command line option.

A batch file "vvvv_dx9ex.bat" is provided, but is hard coded with a path that
might not be suitable for you, so you need to modify it for your own system.

The command in the batch file is :

C:\VVVV\vvvv_45beta32_x86\vvvv.exe /dx9ex

Edit the batch file to change the VVVV executable path. Then run it to open VVVV.

If this does not work, use the VVVV utility "crack" to find out what the problem might be.

1) Start VVVV using the dx9 argument.
2) Double click on "Spout_Receiver.v4p".
3) Run the Spout demo sender.

The default sender name will be : "Spout Sender 32bit.exe"
The receiver should immediately start to display the sender output.
The sender name can be changed for other senders.
