“SpoutReceiver2.dll” and “SpoutSender2.dll” are 32bit FreeframeGL plugins and must be copied into the plugin folder of the host application.

For “Resolume Avenue” or “Resolume Arena”, copy them to the plugin “vfx” folder. 

Typically this might be (for a 64 bit Windows system) :

    C:\Program Files (x86)\Resolume Arena 4.1.8\plugins\vfx
