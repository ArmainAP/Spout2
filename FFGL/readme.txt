Spout2 - FreeFrameGL plugins

“SpoutReceiver2.dll” and “SpoutSender2.dll” are 32bit FreeframeGL plugins 
and must be copied into the plugin folder of the host application.
For “Resolume Avenue” or “Resolume Arena”, copy them to the plugin “vfx” folder. 
Typically this might be (for a 32 bit Windows system) :

C:\Program Files\Resolume Arena 4.1.9\plugins\vfx\

or for a 64bit system it might be :

C:\Program Files (x86)\Resolume Arena 4.1.8\plugins\vfx

SpoutPanel.exe is an executable program used by SpoutReceiver2 that shows the list
of running Spout senders and allows the user to select one. This has to be copied
to the host application path, not the plugins folder.
