Full original plugin source is available here :

http://sourceforge.net/projects/milkdrop2/files/milkdrop2_v2.25c_OPEN_SOURCED_20130514_orig_code.zip/download

It comes with a VC2008 project which has to be modified to enable the SpoutSDK files to be included as well as the required dependencies for DirectX and OpenGL. 

Revisions :

22.10.14 - changed from Ctrl-Z on and off to default Spout output when the plugin starts
           and Ctrl-Z to disable and enable while it is running.
           Otherwise Spout has to be re-enabled every time another track is selected.
