Spout demo programs

SpoutSDK allows either DirectX9 or DirectX 11 texture sharing.
These demo programs are useful for testing of compatibility of an application.
The DX9 receiver will only receive from a DX9 sender unless the texture format is compatible.
The DX11 receiver will receive from both.
Memoryshare can be used for systems which do not support the GL/DX OpenGL extensions.
