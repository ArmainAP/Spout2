["Spout"](http://spout.zeal.co/) is a video frame sharing system for Microsoft Windows, which allows applications for Microsoft Windows to share OpenGL textures in a similar way to Syphon for the Mac.

Spout supports DirectX 9, DirectX 11 and OpenGL textures and includes a developer SDK and sample applications. If you are interested in assisting with development testing, please contact us using the GitHub repository email.

Your support will help the project continue and develop.
